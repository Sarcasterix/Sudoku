## Files
### Sudoku.py
This contains the basic board state, alongside manipulation functions.
The main method within this file allows for testing of game logic, through three included games.
Both Implicit and Explicit solution algorithms are included. Explicit solutions are found when there is only a single allowable number for a given space. Implicit solutions are found when only one of the multiple possible numbers within a space are not possible within any others in the Row, Column or Square being checked.
